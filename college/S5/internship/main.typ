= Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow

== Architecture of a regression model
 

 Input shapes and output shapes
  - `X`: features/data (inputs)
  - `y`: labels (outputs)
- Creating custom data to view and fit
- Steps in modelling
  - Creating a model
  - Compiling a model
    - Defining a loss function
    - Setting up an optimizer
    - Creating evaluation metrics
  - Fitting a model (getting it to find patterns in our data)
- Evaluating a model
  - Visualizng the model ("visualize, visualize, visualize")
  - Looking at training curves
  - Compare predictions to ground truth (using our evaluation metrics)
- Saving a model (so we can use it later)
